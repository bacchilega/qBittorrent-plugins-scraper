## 🛠️ What is this?  
This is a Python script I created in 2022 while learning BeautifulSoup. Its purpose is to automate the process of downloading `.py` search plugins for qBittorrent. Since there’s no straightforward way to get these plugins automatically, I decided to make it happen with a simple scraper.

## 📦 How to Use It  

1. **Install the Required Libraries**  
   Make sure Python is installed on your machine. Then install `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` using pip:  
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository to your local machine:  
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/bacchilega/qBittorrent-plugins-scraper/>
   ```

3. **Run the Script**  
   Navigate to the project directory and execute the script:  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Install the Plugins in qBittorrent**  
   Once the `.py` files are downloaded, you can add them as plugins in qBittorrent. Follow the steps in this guide: [Install search plugins](https://github.com/qbittorrent/search-plugins/wiki/Unofficial-search-plugins).

## 🤔 Why Did I Build This?
